# Open Governance

The open governance of a project determines who has influence and control beyond what is legally required in an open source license. There are certain aspects of a projects ownership, from the copyright, trademarks, domains to even source control and build systems.

In short, there is a difference between open source and open governance.

## Checklist

The open governance of a project requires open ownership of the projects assets and decision making process.

### Ownership

* Who owns the copyright on contributed code?
* Who owns the domain(s) for the project?
* Who owns the trademark for the project, is it neutrally owned and governed? Are there open trademark guidelines?
* How can users license the project’s branding? Are there open branding guidelines?
* If the project raises funds, who owns it?

### Process

* Who makes decisions on how the project performs releases?
* How can the project contributors become committers?
* How are project committers removed?
* If the project raises funds, who decides how this money is spent?
* Who decides the project roadmap?
* Who can participate in security disclosure issues?
* How transparent are the decision-making processes?
* Who enforces the code of conduct?

## Examples

### Projects

Many open source projects out there don't have open governance and there are multiple ways to specify governance. Here are some good examples from you to learn from:

* https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
* https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
* https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
* https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/governance/governance.md
* https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md
* https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
* https://prometheus.io/governance/

### Foundations

Most open source foundations exhibit open governance via their bylaws and/or charter:

* https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/
